What Do We Do Now?
Create a 90 Day Plan
• Forecast through the initial 90 days of uncertainty
• Will consumers immediately return after 90 days? Or slowly scale up?
Create a 180 Day Plan
• Evaluate cash required. Is it readily available? Will we need to borrow? Is it worth it?
EVALUATE

<!-- Slide number: 3 -->
Art of Forecasting in Crisis
Plan out monthly gross margin first
Look a non-labor expenses second to see what can be turned off or delayed
Look a direct labor to what is needed to operate
Look at management labor last
Evaluate resources and runway consider cash, access to debt or disaster loan assistance and then decide if you can support more labor at full or reduce pay or if you have to cut faster.

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->
Profit is Different than Cash Flow
■	Every business model has a distinct profit and cash flow signature
■	In a time of crisis, you need a keen understanding of when profit turns into cash
■	Expect disruption of normal terms
■	You will get paid slower
■	You may have to pay faster
■	If you carry Accounts Receivable or Inventory, it will be easier to get loan assistance than a business that does not have those.
■	Let’s look a 3 examples

<!-- Slide number: 9 -->
Trade Capital % compared to Profit % is the key to understanding cash flow as you scale up out of a business slump.
In Simple Numbers terminology:
Trade Capital + Buffer Capital = Working Capital
Trade Capital is forced on you by the market, Buffer Capital (Cash & Debt) are choices based on your access to resources.

<!-- Slide number: 10 -->
Trade Capital -
Add: A/R + Inventory + Work Less: A/P + Accrued Expenses in Progress	+ Deferred Revenue

Infrastructure Capital - Investment above debt support for Equipment, Buildings and other long term assets that depreciate
4 Needs for Capital

![](Рисунок2.jpg)
Buffer Capital - Core Capital Target (2 months of operating expenses in cash)

![](Рисунок3.jpg)
Launch Capital - Losses to be funded for a new activity, startup or next stage, or temporary crisis until you break even

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
Revisiting the Four Five Forces of Cash Flow
Prioritized in order:
1.	Make Reinvestments into Business at 50% ROI
2.	Set Aside Tax Liability (Quarterly)
3.	Repay Line of Credit (LOC) Debt
4.	Core Capital Target in Reserves - 2 months of operating expenses and Direct Labor in cash with nothing drawn on Line of Credit (LOC)
5.	Pay Dividends (Distributions)
This is the priority order for cash to be used from profits

Launch Capital Process
Identify the initial new spend that will be the catalyst to the new activity (marketing, labor, facilities)

![](Рисунок1.jpg)
Forecast how much losses will be until the activity will break even. Those losses represent “launch capital”

![](Рисунок2.jpg)
Establish expectation of profit increase (and when) from that spend

![](Рисунок3.jpg)
Our standard is minimum of 50% return with 12 to 24 months

Step Three: Revenue and GM% (PL)
Forecast Revenues
Next 90 Days
■	What is immediate impact to revenues?
After Initial 90 Days
■	Will revenue pop back up to normal operations?
■	Will revenue slowly creep back up?
■	What is long term affects on your industry and company?
■	What are affects to your competition?
■	Are there opportunities we can prepare for now to profit on ater?
■
■

![](Рисунок1.jpg)
■

<!-- Slide number: 19 -->
Step Four: Operating Expenses (PL)
■	Forecast operating expenses
■	What operating expenses can we reduce without effecting future operations? What can we eliminate altogether?
■	Lease / Rent Expenses
■	Marketing
■	Management Labor reductions or temporary decrease in pay

![](Рисунок1.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 20 -->
Step Five: Direct Labor (PL)
■	Forecast Direct Labor costs (unburdened)
■	If Revenue declines, will Direct Labor also decline?
■	i.e. Pay by Job
■ Staff Reductions?

![](Рисунок1.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 21 -->
Step Six: Key Drivers (BS)
■	Utilize your knowledge of sector and prior performance to forecast these drivers.
■	A/R Days - If you know your customers are strongly effected (offices closed, etc), then you can assume your A/R Days will be higher than normal for the next 90 days, then returning to normal levels.
■	A/P Days - If you can extend out some of your payment terms on payables, then you should increase the AP Days.

<!-- Slide number: 22 -->
Step Seven: Trade Capital (BS)
■	Forecast for Inventory, Other Current Assets, and Other Liabilities.
■	If your inventory is seasonal, link the $$ to same month prior year (with edits as needed for the crisis)

<!-- Slide number: 23 -->
Step Eight: Infrastructure & Buffer Capital (BS)
■	Forecast Fixed Asset purchases, any Fixed Term Debt, and any Line of Credit balances here.
■	Note: Many Banks are deferring payments and new loans have very low interest rates.
■	SBA Disaster Loans are good for longer term financing at low interest rates.
■	Stay informed on local (City and State) resources
■	Template helps to quantify the cash flow need, given certain parameters and decisions.

<!-- Slide number: 24 -->
Step Nine: Distributions & Contributions
■	Include any Tax Distributions
■	STOP Profit Distributions
■	Is there cash that can be Contributed to the
company from owner(s)? How much are you willing to invest?

![](Рисунок1.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 25 -->
Step Ten: Stop. Analyze.
■	Look at debt incurred and determine how long it will take to repay? Delayed gratification because once operations return to normal, still repaying debt.
■	If you have cash, if you could get a loan, how long will it take of future normal operations to repay?
■	Is it better to go dark and relaunch business at future time (fixing all the things you would do differently)? Dark could be closing doors and liquidating OR just temporarily closing business.
■	Prepare 3 versions - best, worst, expected
